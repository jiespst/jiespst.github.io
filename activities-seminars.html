			Moduli spaces of hyperKahler manifolds and cubics 
			
			</td>
				   	        <td  style="width: 500px;"> 
							The study of moduli spaces of hyperKahler manifolds and low dimensional 
							cubic hypersurfaces is an active direction in algebraic geometry. 
							Thanks to kinds of Torelli theorem, many moduli spaces can be realized as locally 
							symmetric varieties of unitary type or orthogonal type. Hodge theory, birational geometry 
							and arithmetic geometry converge in this topic. 
							In this talk I will give a general introduction to the theory and examples, 
							and discuss the future directions.

				 and the moduli space of curves. This is joint work with Karl Christ and Ilya Tyomkin.

				Stable holomorphic bundles are objects in algebraic geometry which have been studied by many people. Instanton Floer homology is an invariant of 3-manifolds, which has been used to solve many problems in the low dimensional topology. It turns out the two things are closely related: knowledge on the moduli space of stable bundles can help the calculation of Instanton Floer homology.  In this talk, I will explain this relationship and its generalization to stable parabolic bundles. This is joint work with Boyu Zhang.

			</td>
		         <td  style="width: 500px;"> 
				The seminar "Geometry, Arithmetic and Differential Equations of Periods" (GADEPs), started in the pandemic 
				 year 2020 and its aim is to gather people in different areas of mathematics around the notion of periods which are 
				 certain multiple integrals. This is the second GADEPs conference focused on periods and Hodge theory of Calabi-Yau varieties with applications 
				 toward computing Gromov-Witten invariants. The study of higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants is one of the core problems in 
				 both symplectic and enumerative algebraic geometry. For Calabi-Yau threefolds, mirror symmetry invented by physicists 
				 has made remarkable conjectures on the differential structures of higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants known as BCOV. 
				 It uses the Hodge theory and periods of the mirror Calabi-Yau threefold. Recently, there has been many progress both 
				 in the mathematical framework of BCOV using enhanced Calabi-Yau varieties and also in proving these conjectures rigorously for quintic. 
				 The main aim of the workshop, is to gather experts ranging from enumerative algebraic geometry and Hodge theory to symplectic geometry.   </td>

				 We briefly review the origin in physics of attractor points on the moduli space of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We turn to their mathematical interpretation as special cases of Hodge loci. This leads to fascinating conjectures on the modularity of the Calabi-Yau threefolds at these points in terms of their periods and L-functions. For hypergeometric one-parameter families of Calabi-Yau threefolds, these conjectures can be verified at least numerically to very high precision.

				 We study the moduli space of cubic threefolds admitting an involution via the period map sending such a cubic threefold to the invariant/anti-invariant part of the intermediate Jacobian.  Our main result is global Torelli holds for the period map. Key ingredients of the proof include a description of the invariant/anti-invariant part of the intermediate Jacobian as a Prym variety and a detailed study of certain positive dimensional fibers of the corresponding Prym map. 
						   The proof also relies on the results of Donagi-Smith, Ikeda and Naranjo-Ortega on related Prym maps. This is joint work with S. Casalaina-Martin and L. Marquand.

			</td>
		         <td  style="width: 500px;"> 
				 Sheaves on non-reduced curves can appear in moduli spaces of 1-dimensional semistable sheaves over a surface, 
						   and moduli spaces of Higgs bundles as well. We estimate the dimension of the stack
						   M_X(nC, \chi) of pure sheaves supported at the non-reduced curve nC (n ≥ 2) with C an integral curve on X. 
						   We prove that the Hilbert-Chow morphism h_{L,\chi} : M_X^H(L, \chi) → 
						   |L| sending each semistable 1-dimensional sheaf to its support have all its fibers of the same dimension for 
						   X Fano or with trivial canonical line bundle and |L| contains integral curves.  
						   The strategy is to firstly deal with the case with C smooth and then do induction on the arithmetic genus of C 
						   which once can decrease by a blow-up given C singular.  
						   As an application, we generalize the result of Maulik-Shen on the cohomology 
						   \chi-independence of M_X^H(L,\chi) to X any del Pezzo surface not necessarily toric.

			</td>
		         <td  style="width: 500px;"> 
				A conic fibration has an associated sheaf of even Clifford algebra on the base. In this talk, I will discuss the relation between the moduli spaces of modules over the sheaf of even Clifford algebra and the Prym variety associated to the conic fibration. I will begin by motivating the connection between them from the viewpoint of the rationality problem of cubic hypersurfaces. Then I will explain the construction of a rational map from the moduli space of modules over the sheaf of even Clifford algebra to the special subvarieties in Prym varieties. 
						   As an application, we get an explicit correspondence between instanton bundles of minimal charge on cubic threefolds and twisted Higgs bundles on curves.

				The degeneration of Hodge structures is related to how a smooth projective variety degenerate. And it provides a Hodge-theoretic perspective to compactify moduli spaces. In this talk, I will focus on a particular degeneration of cubic hypersurfaces and study the associated limiting mixed Hodge structure. It generalizes some results in Radu Laza’s and Brendan Hassett’s works on cubic fourfolds. This is a joint work with Zhiwei Zheng.
